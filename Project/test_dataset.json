"Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning?": {
"Marks": 5,
"Answers": [
"Supervised machine learning involves training a model on labeled data with a known output to make predictions on new, unseen data. Unsupervised machine learning involves finding patterns and relationships in data without any prior knowledge of the output, and is used for clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection."

"Explain the difference between KNN and K-Means clustering?": {
"Marks": 5,
"Answers": [
"KNN is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression, while K-means is an unsupervised algorithm used for clustering.",
"KNN is based on finding the k nearest neighbors to a data point, while K-means iteratively assigns data points to k clusters based on their similarity."

"How to ensure that your model is not overfitting?": {
"Marks": 5,
"Answers": [
"Simplify the model to reduce complexity and overfitting.",
"Regularize the model with techniques like L1/L2 regularization.",
"Employ early stopping to prevent the model from fitting to the training data too closely."

"What are the different sets in which we divide any dataset for Machine Learning?": {
"Marks": 5,
"Answers": [
"Training set: The data used to train the model.",
"Validation set: The data used to evaluate the performance of the model during training.",
"Holdout set: A randomly selected subset of the data used for model evaluation after training."

"Explain Dimensionality Reduction in machine learning?": {
"Marks": 5,
"Answers": [
"Dimensionality reduction is a technique used to reduce the number of input features while retaining the most important information.",
"It helps to simplify the dataset and avoid overfitting, as well as reduce the computational complexity of the model."
